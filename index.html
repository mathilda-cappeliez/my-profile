                Currently a student and a golfer, I enjoy moving from one thing to another. Indeed, at 22, my life is already full of excitement. Globe trotter, english fluent, professionnal golfer and now first year student at Ieseg, I am continuously learning day after day.

            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                My life enjoyment rounds around different things, but one of my favortite hobby might be the discovery of various types of food. 
                As well, I like to be surrounded by my family and share precious times with them. 
                Finally, I love travelling to new places and get to know other cultures and rituals all around the world.

            <h2>My passion </h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate about sport. I do like playing and watching it. What I enjoy the most in my daily life is certainly playing golf, swimming or either running.

            <h2>My projects</h2>
            <p>
                At this time, I can think of two distinct projects. One has to deal with golf, my all time sport, and the other turns around the business and its management. The two has great potential in my mind but depending on my evolution throughout my studies, I will either decide one or the other. However, I would like both of them at the international scale, to take advantage of my good english interaction.
